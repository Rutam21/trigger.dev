Tasks are executed after the job is triggered and are the main building blocks of a job. You can string together as many tasks as you want.

## All tasks

### `sendEmail`

Send an email with a payload text. [Official SendGrid Docs](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email)

```ts example.ts
run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
  // The 'run' function is asynchronous and takes 'payload,' 'io,' and 'ctx' as parameters.

  // Using the 'io.sendgrid.sendEmail' method to send an email using SendGrid.
  await io.sendgrid.sendEmail({
    to: payload.to, // Recipient's email address, obtained from the 'payload' parameter.
    from: "Trigger.dev <hello@email.trigger.dev>", // Sender's email address and name.
    subject: payload.subject, // Email subject, obtained from the 'payload' parameter.
    text: payload.text, // Plain text content of the email, obtained from the 'payload' parameter.
  });
}

```

## Example usage

In this example, we will send weekly summary emails to users who have `summariesEnabled = true`, at 4pm every Friday, and then posts the total numbers to Slack.

```ts example.ts
import { TriggerClient, cronTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { SendGrid } from "@trigger.dev/sendgrid";
import { Slack } from "@trigger.dev/slack";
import { weeklySummaryDb } from "./mocks/db";
import { weeklySummaryEmail } from "./mocks/emails";

// Creating an instance of the TriggerClient with a unique identifier "jobs-showcase."
const client = new TriggerClient({ id: "jobs-showcase" });

// Creating instances of SendGrid and Slack clients.
const sendgrid = new SendGrid({
  id: "sendgrid",
  apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!,
});

const slack = new Slack({ id: "slack" });

// Defining a job that sends a weekly summary email to users and posts total numbers to Slack.
client.defineJob({
  id: "weekly-user-activity-summary", // Unique identifier for the job.
  name: "Weekly user activity summary", // A specific name for the job.
  version: "1.0.0", // Version number for the job.
  integrations: { sendgrid, slack }, // Integrating SendGrid and Slack clients into this job.
  trigger: cronTrigger({
    // Setting a cron schedule to run the job every Friday at 4 pm.
    cron: "0 16 * * 5",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // Inside the 'run' function, several operations are performed to send weekly summaries and post to Slack.

    // Retrieving a list of users from the weeklySummaryDb.
    const users = await weeklySummaryDb.getUsers();

    let sentCount = 0;
    let notSentCount = 0;

    // Iterating through the list of users.
    for (const user of users) {
      if (user.summariesEnabled) {
        // Sending a weekly summary email to users with summaries enabled.
        await io.sendgrid.sendEmail(`Weekly summary for ${user.id}`, {
          to: user.email,
          from: "hello@acme.inc", // The sender's email.
          subject: "Your weekly summary",
          html: weeklySummaryEmail(user), // HTML content for the email.
        });
        sentCount++;
      } else {
        notSentCount++;
      }
    }

    // Posting a message to Slack with a summary of the sent and unsent emails.
    await io.slack.postMessage("Notify team", {
      text: `Weekly summary sent to ${sentCount} users and not sent to ${notSentCount} users`,
      channel: "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID", // Specify the Slack channel ID for posting the message.
    });
  },
});

// If you're not using Express, you can remove these lines.
import { createExpressServer } from "@trigger.dev/express";
createExpressServer(client);
```
